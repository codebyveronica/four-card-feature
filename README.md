## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query
- Multi-columns

### What I learned

I learned to use multi-columns. I didn't know this property existed and it was fun to learn how to use it. I believe that CSS Grid is probably a better application than what I did, but it is a way to learn Grid in the future.

### Continued development

Now that I understand better how columns work, I believe it's a good time to start learning Grid too.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me a lot in researching CSS properties including multiple columns
